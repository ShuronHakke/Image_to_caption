**Image Captioning with BLIP Model**
This project demonstrates how to generate captions for images using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model by Salesforce. BLIP is a state-of-the-art image captioning model that leverages both vision and language understanding to generate accurate and descriptive captions for images. The project utilizes the pre-trained BLIP model available via Hugging Face's transformers library.

With this project, users can easily upload an image and receive a generated caption, making it ideal for applications in image analysis, content creation, accessibility tools, and more.

Features
Image-to-Text Conversion: Automatically generates a textual description of an image using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Simple Integration: Use the Python script to upload an image and generate captions with minimal setup.
Pre-trained Model: The BLIP model is pre-trained and available via the Hugging Face transformers library, which ensures high accuracy in generating captions.
Colab Compatibility: This project is designed to work in Google Colab for easy usage and interaction with the model.
