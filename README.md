**Image Captioning with BLIP Model**
This project demonstrates how to generate captions for images using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model by Salesforce. BLIP is a state-of-the-art image captioning model that leverages both vision and language understanding to generate accurate and descriptive captions for images. The project utilizes the pre-trained BLIP model available via Hugging Face's transformers library.

With this project, users can easily upload an image and receive a generated caption, making it ideal for applications in image analysis, content creation, accessibility tools, and more.

**Features**
Image-to-Text Conversion: Automatically generates a textual description of an image using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Simple Integration: Use the Python script to upload an image and generate captions with minimal setup.
Pre-trained Model: The BLIP model is pre-trained and available via the Hugging Face transformers library, which ensures high accuracy in generating captions.
Colab Compatibility: This project is designed to work in Google Colab for easy usage and interaction with the model.
Requirements
To run the code, you’ll need to install the required dependencies, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them using the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies:
transformers: For using the pre-trained BLIP image captioning model.
pillow: For handling and processing images.
google-colab: To support image upload functionality in Google Colab.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine or Google Colab environment:
git clone https://github.com/ShuronHakke/image-captioning-project.git
cd image-captioning-project
Install Dependencies: Use the requirements.txt file to install all the necessary dependencies:


**pip install -r requirements.txt**
Run the Script: To generate a caption for an image, run the image_to_text.py script. This will prompt you to upload an image, and then it will generate a caption for it.

**python scripts/image_to_text.py**

Upload an Image: When prompted, upload an image of your choice. The model will process the image and generate a caption for it.

View the Caption: The generated caption will be displayed in the output, showing a description of the image.


Generated Caption: "A person sitting on a bench with a bag next to them."

**How the Model Works**
Image Processing: The uploaded image is processed using the BLIP model, which uses deep learning techniques to analyze the image.
Text Generation: The BLIP model generates a caption based on its understanding of the image’s content, combining both visual features and textual knowledge.
